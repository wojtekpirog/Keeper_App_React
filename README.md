# Keeper App React
**A React Notepad application that enables its user to create, edit and delete notes, as well as change the theme color of each note**

The application is being built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, React.js and a bunch of third-party visual components from the Material UI React UI component library. The app's design is inspired by the design of the original Keep app from Google. For me this is an opportunity to practise my skill of recreating graphical UI designs from UI design applications like Figma. The application is currently under development.

## Features
* **Current date and time** - You can see the current date and time in the upper right corner of the screen.
* **Creating notes** - you can create a new note in a note creation form by putting in the note's title and content and then clicking on the _Create_ button. A new note will appear below the form.
* **Deleting notes** - You can delete an unnecessary note by clicking on the red _Delete_ button in a menu under its content.
* **Changing the theme background color** (***under development***) - For each note individually you will have the ability to change the theme color of its background by clicking on the _color palette_ icon in a menu under its content and selecting any of the available colors. 
* **Editing notes** (***under development***) - You will have the ability to change the title and the content of any note you have created. The note will be updated automatically after clicking on the _Save_ button.

## Technologies

The technologies used during the development of the application are:

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript ES6
* React.js
* [Material UI - React UI component library](https://mui.com/)
